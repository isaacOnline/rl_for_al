This directory is a package that registers uniform and non uniform 
environments with Open AI Gym. After `gym` has been installed, it can be 
installed with `pip install -e change-point`. Instances of uniform/non-uniform 
environments can then be created with 
`gym.make('change_point:uniform-v0')` or `gym.make(change_point:non_uniform-v0)`
